    "description": "Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. We are driven by the excitement of building technologies, inventing products, and providing services that change lives. We embrace new ways of doing things, make decisions quickly, and are not afraid to fail. We have the scope and capabilities of a large company, and the spirit and heart of a small one.\n\nTogether, Amazonians research and develop new technologies from Amazon Web Services to Alexa on behalf of our customers: shoppers, sellers, content creators, and developers around the world.\n\nOur mission is to be Earth's most customer-centric company. Our actions, goals, projects, programs, and inventions begin and end with the customer top of mind.\n\nYou'll also hear us say that at Amazon, it's always \"Day 1.\" What do we mean? That our approach remains the same as it was on Amazon's very first day - to make smart, fast decisions, stay nimble, invent, and focus on delighting our customers.",

    "description": "Crossover is a global recruitment company, founded in 2014. We're the world's largest recruiter that specializes in elite full-time remote jobs, hiring the top 1% of tech talent from every corner of the planet.\n\nWe find awesome talent in overlooked places, by posting jobs all over the world, and giving everyone an equal opportunity to prove their skills are world-class. Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\nùêáùêÑùêãùêèùêÖùêîùêã ùêãùêàùêçùêäùêí:\n Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\nùëµùíêùíïùíÜ: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",
